# Gender-and-Age-Detection-by-using-CNN
Age and gender detection systems has become increasingly prevalent across various domains, including security, marketing, and human-computer interaction. Traditional methods often fall short in terms of accuracy and real-time capabilities, necessitating the development of more advanced solutions. This project aims to address this challenge by designing and implementing a real-time age and gender detection system using deep learning techniques.

The primary goal of the project is to develop a system capable of processing live video feeds from a webcam, detecting faces, and accurately predicting the age and gender of individuals present in the frames. This involves overcoming challenges such as varying lighting conditions, facial expressions, and occlusions while maintaining real-time performance. The expected outcomes include the creation of a robust and accurate detection system optimized for real-time operation on standard hardware.
